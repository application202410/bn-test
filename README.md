## Installation and Running the Project
TODO


## Approach
The brief (and my conversation) stressed the need to keep this simple, so I'm going to start by getting all the basics done, build and the recommendation algorithm and then see how much time I hacve left to play with it and improve it.

I've divided this into a few key tasks:
- Project setup and basic 'Hello World' run instructions
- General project structure
- Download and parse phase
- Person-Job matching phase
- Output


### Project setup
I've reviewed enough developer tests to know how much I appreciate decent, clear and fuss-free instructions to get the code running. For nice, universal ease the approach I'm going with is:
- devcontainer file for development
- simple Dockerfile for 'production' run
- Docker compose file just to save on running Docker commands: I want this to be a one-command launch.

This feels like a good balance between simplicity of use and setup.
