Bright Network Hiring Challenge
At Bright Network, matching graduates with their ideal first jobs and employers with their ideal graduate intake is core to what we do. This technical challenge is designed to give you a flavour of what it might be like to work for us and for us to assess the kind of developer you are and the skills and approach to problem-solving you're bringing to the table.
 
In one of our suggested programming languages, please implement a very simple recommendations algorithm to match members to their perfect job.
 
The code needs to fetch the required data from the following APIs:
https://bn-hiring-challenge.fly.dev/members.json
https://bn-hiring-challenge.fly.dev/jobs.json
 
For each member, please print their name and their recommended job(s).
 
We'd like you to spend no more than 3 hours on the problem, so your solution will not be perfect (and that's absolutely fine). The purpose is to let us see some of your code, and to give us something to discuss in the technical interview.
 
Please work in a git repository, and share the repository with us via either a link or zip file. Please include a README which contains, at a minimum, instructions for installing and running your submission, a brief acknowledgement of the challenges posed by the problem and its domain and a discussion of the choices you've made and your reasons. Think of the README as a one-sided pre-interview conversation on the problem and your submission.
 
As a rough guide on what we'd like to see, whilst a single script wouldn't give us an indication of how you typically organise your code, we are also not looking for 10 different modules for this task, for example. Our priority is to see good evidence of your coding ability and we want you to approach this in the same way you would if you were tasked on working on this solution at work.
